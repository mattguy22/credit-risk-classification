# **Credit Risk Classification Project**

Created by Matthew Guy, 2025

A machine learning project focused on predicting borrower creditworthiness using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Logistic Regression**. This project trains a binary classification model to identify high-risk loans from historical lending data.

## **Credit Risk Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers using a logistic regression model. This model was trained on a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to accurately classify borrowers as either **low risk (0)** or **high risk (1)** based on financial data, helping the company make informed lending decisions.

The dataset used in this analysis included the following key financial features:

- **loan_size**: The amount of the loan.
- **interest_rate**: The interest rate of the loan.
- **borrower_income**: The annual income of the borrower.
- **debt_to_income**: The ratio of the borrower‚Äôs debt to their income.
- **num_of_accounts**: The number of financial accounts the borrower has.
- **derogatory_marks**: The number of negative marks on the borrower‚Äôs credit history.
- **total_debt**: The total amount of debt the borrower holds.

The analysis involved the following stages:

- Data preprocessing (splitting data into features and labels)
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split)
- Training a logistic regression model using the training set
- Evaluating the model‚Äôs performance on the testing set

### **Results**

- **Accuracy**: 99%  
- **Precision for Healthy Loans (0)**: 100%  
- **Recall for Healthy Loans (0)**: 99%  
- **Precision for High-Risk Loans (1)**: 86%  
- **Recall for High-Risk Loans (1)**: 94%  

### **Summary**

The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well on this dataset, achieving an overall accuracy of 99%. It demonstrated perfect precision (100%) for predicting healthy loans (0) and high recall (94%) for identifying high-risk loans (1). This indicates the model is highly effective at correctly classifying healthy loans while also being strong at identifying high-risk cases.

However, the precision for high-risk loans (1) is slightly lower at 86%, meaning that a small percentage of loans classified as high-risk may actually be healthy. Despite this minor limitation, the model‚Äôs overall performance is strong, making it a suitable choice for this credit risk classification task.

Given the high accuracy, precision, and recall scores, I would recommend using this logistic regression model for credit risk classification, as it effectively balances sensitivity (recall) and specificity (precision), providing reliable predictions for both healthy and high-risk loans.
